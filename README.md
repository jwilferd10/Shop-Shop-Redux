## Description:
For this particular challenge I worked on a website called Shop-Shop! The entire purpose was to refactor the pre-existing code to use Redux. This was made possible by using the Redux documentation that step-by-step helped out tremendously in efficiently 'cleaning' up pre-existing code.

## User Story
**AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform**
- I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
- SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

**GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state**
- WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
  - THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
  - THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
  - THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
  - THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
  - THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
